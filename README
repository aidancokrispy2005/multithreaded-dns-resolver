# Multithreaded DNS Resolver

## Overview

My multi-lookup implementation uses a struct called `filename_queue` to assign files to requester threads. Filenames passed in through the command line are loaded into our `filename_queue` in `main()` (also storing the amount of filenames loaded), and requester threads are able to dynamically claim files with `filename_queue_get()`, with access being synchronized through the queue's mutex lock attribute.

The number of filenames loaded (`count`) is compared with `next_to_process` to determine if a requester thread has any filenames left to claim.

After the requester threads are joined, no more hostnames can be added to the shared array `req_res_array`. Thus, the string `"POISON_PILL"` is sent into the shared bounded buffer queue `req_res_array` via an `array_put()` call for each active resolver thread. Resolver threads continuously grabbing hostnames from the queue will detect the poison pill and exit accordingly.

## Usage

```
multi-lookup <# requester> <# resolver> <requester log> <resolver log> [ <data file> ... ]
```
